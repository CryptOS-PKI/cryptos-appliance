// Package integration holds the Phase 1 end-to-end acceptance test: it
// boots the UKI in QEMU + swtpm + OVMF, drives the first-boot ceremony
// with cryptosctl, and checks the Root certificate with zlint.
//
// The test is guarded by the `integration` build tag and skips unless the
// toolchain (qemu, swtpm, OVMF, a built UKI, cryptosctl, zlint) is
// present, so it is inert under a normal `go test ./...`. Run it with
// `go test -tags=integration ./test/integration/` (or `task
// test:integration`) on a Linux host that has the toolchain.
