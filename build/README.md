# Image build pipeline

> **Status: DRAFT.** These recipes are written but **not yet executed** —
> they need a Linux build host (kernel toolchain, `mksquashfs`, `ukify`,
> `sbsign`, `cpio`). Treat the shell scripts as reviewed skeletons, not
> validated builds. The version pins (`ci/versions.env`) and the kernel
> config (`kernel/cryptos.config`) are the reviewable, load-bearing parts.

## Pipeline

```
versions.env ──> kernel/build.sh      ─> out/vmlinuz-<arch>
                 cryptsetup/build.sh   ─> out/cryptsetup-<arch>      (static, musl)
                 e2fsprogs/build.sh    ─> out/mke2fs-<arch>           (static, glibc)
                 gptfdisk/build.sh     ─> out/sgdisk-<arch>           (static, glibc)
                 dosfstools/build.sh   ─> out/mkfs.vfat-<arch>        (static, glibc)
                 squashfs/build.sh     ─> out/rootfs-<arch>.squashfs  (+ rootfs tree)
                 uki/assemble.sh       ─> out/cryptos-<arch>.uki.unsigned
                 uki/sign.sh           ─> out/cryptos-<arch>.uki      (Secure Boot signed)
                 iso/build.sh          ─> out/cryptos-<arch>-<platform>[-nodeid][-unsigned].iso
```

Driven by the `Taskfile.yml` targets:

| Task | Does |
|---|---|
| `task kernel:build` | fetch + checksum + build the pinned hardened kernel |
| `task cryptsetup:build` | build the static `cryptsetup` from source (Docker + Alpine/musl) |
| `task e2fsprogs:build` | build the static `mke2fs`/`mkfs.ext4` from source (Docker + Debian/glibc) |
| `task sgdisk:build` | build the static `sgdisk` (gptfdisk) from source (Docker + Debian/glibc) |
| `task mkfsvfat:build` | build the static `mkfs.vfat` (dosfstools) from source (Docker + Debian/glibc) |
| `task rootfs:build` | assemble the rootfs tree (init, cryptosctl, static tools) + pack SquashFS |
| `task uki:assemble` | build the unsigned UKI (kernel + initrd + cmdline) |
| `task uki:sign` | Secure Boot-sign the UKI |
| `task image` | the full prod chain end to end (needs `SB_KEY`/`SB_CERT`) |
| `task iso` | `task image`, then wrap the signed UKI in a UEFI ISO |
| `task image:unsigned` | the prod chain without signing and without an upgrade anchor; ends at `uki:assemble` |
| `task iso:unsigned` | `task image:unsigned`, then wrap the unsigned UKI in an ISO named `-unsigned` |
| `task image:debug` | a debug UKI (qemu-dev cmdline + serial console); never published |
| `task qemu:run` | boot the debug image in QEMU + swtpm interactively |

## Toolchain

The build host needs the kernel build deps (`build-essential`, `bc`, `flex`,
`bison`, `libelf-dev`, `libssl-dev`, `xz-utils`), `squashfs-tools`
(`mksquashfs`), `cpio`, `sbsigntool` (`sbsign`), Docker (for the static
`cryptsetup`), and the UKI tooling: `systemd-ukify` + `systemd-boot-efi` (the
EFI stub). See `.github/workflows/ci-image.yml` for the exact apt list.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **`ukify` needs the Python `pefile` module.** `systemd-ukify` does not depend
> on it, so `uki:assemble` fails with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named
> 'pefile'` unless `pefile` is installed. On CI/system Python install the
> `python3-pefile` package. Note: `ukify` runs under `#!/usr/bin/env python3`,
> so on a host where a version manager (e.g. pyenv) shadows the system
> interpreter, `python3-pefile` (system) is invisible to it — install into the
> interpreter `ukify` actually resolves, e.g. `python3 -m pip install pefile`.

## Inputs the scripts expect

- `KERNEL_VERSION` in `ci/versions.env` — the kernel is shallow-cloned from the
  matching stable git tag `v${KERNEL_VERSION}` (no tarball checksum to maintain;
  the git tag is the source of truth).
- `CRYPTSETUP_STATIC` — optional override; defaults to the from-source
  static `cryptsetup` produced by `task cryptsetup:build` (Docker required).
- `MKFS_EXT4_STATIC` — optional override; defaults to the from-source
  static `mke2fs` produced by `task e2fsprogs:build` (Docker required).
- `SGDISK_STATIC` — optional override; defaults to the from-source
  static `sgdisk` produced by `task sgdisk:build` (Docker required).
- `MKFS_VFAT_STATIC` — optional override; defaults to the from-source
  static `mkfs.vfat` produced by `task mkfsvfat:build` (Docker required).
- `SB_KEY` / `SB_CERT` — your own Secure Boot signing key + cert (a per-run
  ephemeral key in CI smoke tests). `SB_CERT` is read by `rootfs:build`, which
  stamps it as the upgrade anchor, and by `uki:sign`, so keep both set for the
  whole run. See [`docs/secure-boot.md`](../docs/secure-boot.md). `SB_KEY`
  must be a PEM file; a PKCS#11 URI is not supported. The unsigned tasks
  ignore both.
- `NO_ANCHOR` — set by the unsigned tasks; clears `SB_CERT` for
  `rootfs:build` so no anchor is stamped.
- `UNSIGNED` / `UKI` — for `iso/build.sh`: `UNSIGNED=1` wraps
  `out/cryptos-<arch>.uki.unsigned` instead of the signed UKI, and `UKI=<path>`
  wraps any UKI (treated as unsigned when the path ends in `.unsigned`). An
  unsigned ISO gets `-unsigned` in its name.
- `CRYPTOS_VERSION` — optional override for the stamped version (see below);
  defaults to `git describe --tags --always --dirty`.

## Build identity

Every shipped binary (`init`, `cryptosctl`, `cryptos-console`, the
switch-root shim, and the `task build` outputs) is stamped with the build's
identity through `build/ci/buildinfo.sh`, which prints the `-ldflags -X`
arguments for `internal/buildinfo`:

| Field | Source |
|---|---|
| version | `git describe --tags --always --dirty`, or `CRYPTOS_VERSION` |
| commit | `git rev-parse HEAD`, suffixed `-dirty` for a modified tree |
| build date | the commit time (`SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` if set), so rebuilds stay reproducible |

The node reports the version in `cryptosctl status` and `cryptosctl image
status` and logs all three at boot; `cryptosctl version` prints the CLI's own
identity, plus the node's version when `--endpoint` or `--socket` is given.
Build from a git checkout (CI uses `fetch-depth: 0` so tags resolve): without
git metadata the build still succeeds but reports version `dev` and an
`unknown` commit and date. To stamp another Go build the same way:

```bash
go build -ldflags "-s -w $(build/ci/buildinfo.sh)" ./cmd/cryptosctl
```

## Rootfs delivery

`uki/assemble.sh` defaults to `ROOTFS_MODE=squashfs` (the spec target): a tiny
shim initramfs — the `cryptos-switchroot` `/init` plus the SquashFS image —
loop-mounts the read-only SquashFS and `switch_root`s into it, so the real
PID 1 runs from an immutable, RAM-resident root. `ROOTFS_MODE=initramfs` is a
bring-up fallback that runs init directly from a writable cpio tree. The pivot
sequence is unit-tested; the boot itself is validated in QEMU on a real host.

The rootfs `/etc` is read-only, so `/etc/resolv.conf` is a symlink to
`/run/resolv.conf` on the `/run` tmpfs. Init writes that file at boot from
`network.nameservers` in the machine config, falling back to the nameservers the
kernel's `ip=dhcp` lease reported in `/proc/net/pnp`. With neither, no file is
written and no hostname resolves.

## Open decisions to finalize during Linux validation

1. **arm64.** Scripts parameterize `arch`, but only amd64 is exercised first.

## Image factory (platform ISOs)

`task iso PLATFORM=<platform>` builds a UEFI-bootable ISO for a target platform.
A platform is an additive kernel-config fragment in `build/kernel/profiles/`
(e.g. `vmware.config` = NVMe/AHCI/PVSCSI + e1000e/vmxnet3), merged onto the base
`cryptos.config` during `kernel:build`. The base is unchanged, so builds with no
`PLATFORM` behave as before.

    task iso PLATFORM=vmware        # -> build/out/cryptos-amd64-vmware.iso

    task iso:unsigned PLATFORM=vmware   # -> build/out/cryptos-amd64-vmware-unsigned.iso

Boot it in a UEFI VM (Secure Boot off for an unsigned image, or unless your
certificate is enrolled in `db`). Adding a
platform = adding a `profiles/<name>.config` fragment (keep `CONFIG_MODULES=n`;
every driver is built in). A hosted image-factory service is a future step.

### STATEKEY: the TPM-less nodeID variant

`STATEKEY` selects how the node protects its state partition and Root CA key. It
is orthogonal to `PLATFORM`, defaults to `tpm`, and threads through `task iso`,
`task image`, and `task image:debug`.

    task iso PLATFORM=vmware STATEKEY=nodeid   # -> build/out/cryptos-amd64-vmware-nodeid.iso

The unsigned path takes the same variable: `task iso:unsigned PLATFORM=vmware
STATEKEY=nodeid` writes `build/out/cryptos-amd64-vmware-nodeid-unsigned.iso`.

The default image (no `STATEKEY`, or `STATEKEY=tpm`) is unchanged and
TPM-backed: the state key is sealed to the TPM and the Root CA key is created in
and non-exportable from the TPM.

`STATEKEY=nodeid` builds a variant for hosts that cannot present a vTPM to the
guest (standalone ESXi, vCenter with no key provider, no host TPM). It uses no
TPM at all: the state-partition LUKS key is derived from the SMBIOS product UUID
(`/sys/class/dmi/id/product_uuid`) and the Root CA key is software-generated and
stored on the encrypted state partition. `cryptosctl status` reports
`TPM: UNAVAILABLE` on such a node so the weaker posture is never hidden.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Dev tier only.** A UUID is not secret, so the Root key's confidentiality rests
> on the UUID: an attacker with both the disk image and the node UUID can recover
> the Root key. Use `nodeid` to run CryptOS where a vTPM is unavailable, never for
> a CA guarding real trust.

`STATEKEY` is only the image's default. A machine config can pick another mode
with `state_key.mode` (`tpm`, `nodeid` or `kms`), and that choice is read from
the config staged for the first boot, when the state partition is formatted.
From then on the mode is fixed: every later boot, including one into an
upgraded image built with a different `STATEKEY`, reads it from the state
partition's LUKS2 header (a `cryptos-tpm2` token means `tpm`, a `cryptos-kms`
token means `kms`, no protector token means `nodeid`), not from the image or
the config.

> [!CAUTION]
> The state-key mode cannot be changed on an installed node. `config apply` of a
> config naming a different `state_key.mode` is refused with
> `FailedPrecondition` and nothing is written. To change the mode, reinstall
> the node.

## Machine config delivery

The image is **config-free**: the rootfs carries no `machine.yaml`. Machine
config reaches a node exclusively via the install path:

1. The operator boots the node from the CryptOS UKI into maintenance mode (no
   state partition → init serves the maintenance API).
2. `cryptosctl config apply -f machine.yaml` sends the config to the maintenance
   node, which partitions the target disk, writes the UKI to the ESP, and stages
   the config at `EFI/cryptos/machine.yaml` on that ESP before rebooting.
3. On the first boot of the installed system, init reads the staged config,
   persists it to the encrypted state partition, and deletes the stage file.
4. On every subsequent boot the state-partition copy is the sole source of truth.

## Maintenance install: operator workflow

> [!CAUTION]
> Security note: the maintenance API accepts unauthenticated clients by design
> (the Talos maintenance model). In this mode `config apply` erases the target
> disk and installs a config the caller supplies, then reboots into that
> configuration. Anyone who can reach the maintenance node on port 443 before the
> operator can therefore take over the node. Only expose a maintenance node on a
> trusted, isolated provisioning network, and complete the install before moving
> it onto a general network.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `--insecure` flag disables server-certificate verification and sends no
> client identity. It must only be used against a maintenance endpoint; running
> it against an established node's mTLS port would succeed only if the server
> also accepts unauthenticated clients, which it does not.

When a bare-metal node boots the CryptOS UKI for the first time it has no
state partition, so init enters maintenance mode and listens on a temporary
gRPC endpoint (default port 443) with a self-signed server certificate and
no client authentication. The operator sends the machine config from a
workstation on the same network:

> [!NOTE]
> `cryptosctl` runs on Linux and macOS today. A Windows build is coming.

```sh
cryptosctl \
  --insecure \
  --endpoint <maintenance-node-ip>:443 \
  --server-name localhost \
  config apply -f machine.yaml
```

`machine.yaml` must include an `install.disk` field naming the target block
device (for example `/dev/sda` or `/dev/nvme0n1`). The maintenance node reads
that field from the `ApplyConfig` RPC, partitions the disk, writes the UKI to
the ESP, copies the config to the state partition, and reboots into the
installed system.

> [!TIP]
> A successful apply prints:
>
> ```text
> applied: generation=1 requires_reboot=true digest=<sha256>
> ```

## Not covered here (separate issues)

- Secure Boot key generation and **enrollment** into firmware (this
  pipeline only *signs*). See [`docs/secure-boot.md`](../docs/secure-boot.md).
- The QEMU + swtpm integration harness (the Phase 1 acceptance gate).
