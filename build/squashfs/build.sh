# Assemble the read-only root filesystem tree and pack it as a SquashFS.
# The tree holds the Go PID 1 (/init), cryptosctl, cryptos-console,
# cryptos-install, and the static tools (cryptsetup, mkfs.ext4, sgdisk,
# mkfs.vfat). The image carries no machine config; config reaches the node
# via the ESP stage written by the installer.
#
# init, cryptosctl, cryptos-console and cryptos-install are built BY IMPORT
# PATH from the cryptos-node module this repo's go.mod pins (the PKI engine
# lives there; this repo builds and ships it). Output:
# build/out/rootfs-<arch>.squashfs.
