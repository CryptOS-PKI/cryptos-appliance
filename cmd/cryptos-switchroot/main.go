// Command cryptos-switchroot is the shim init for the SquashFS-root boot
// path. It is the /init of a tiny initramfs that also carries the read-only
// SquashFS rootfs image; it loop-mounts that image and switch_roots into it
// so the real PID 1 (the Go init baked into the SquashFS) runs from an
// immutable, RAM-resident read-only root. See internal/switchroot.
//
// It is only ever run as PID 1 on Linux. On failure there is nowhere to go,
// so it panics — PID 1 dying triggers a kernel panic and reboot, which is
// the correct fail-closed behavior for a trust anchor that can't boot.
